			<h1>Our Demands</h1>
			<p>We believe addressing these demands is crucial to addressing the climate crisis.</p>
			<p>We’re deliberately “demanding the impossible” to grow the power of our coalition.</p>
			<p>Our demands are evolving based on feedback from frontline organizers. If you’re a member of a frontline community or organize with a frontline-led group, let us know.</p>

			<h2>End Climate Imperialism</h2>
			<p><strong>We stand with</strong> indigenous and colonized peoples whose resources have been stolen and whose environments have been turned into sites of capitalist extraction, war, and dumping grounds for empire.</p>
			<p><strong>We fight for</strong> a world where all people have the right to self-determination and healthy environments.</p>

			<h2>Reject Eco-Fascism</h2>
			<p><strong>We stand with</strong> marginalized groups whose resources are stolen by fascist states and whose continued survival is scapegoated as a cause of the climate crisis.</p>
			<p><strong>We fight for</strong> a world without borders and states, where marginalized voices are centered in the search for solutions to the climate crisis.</p>

			<h2>End Gentrification</h2>
			<p><strong>We stand with</strong> homeless people and low-income communities of color whose lives are endangered when they are displaced into areas at higher risk of climate destruction.</p>
			<p><strong>We fight for</strong> a world without landlords and private real estate companies, where communities have access to the resources they need.</p>

			<h2>Prison Abolition</h2>
			<p><strong>We stand with</strong> people of color, undocumented people, LGBTQ people, and others who are caged in the areas of greatest climate risk and whose labor is exploited to fight climate shocks.</p>
			<p><strong>We fight for</strong> a world where all people are seen as vulnerable, and where both victims and perpetrators of violence can participate in interpersonal, communal, and ecological healing.</p>

			<h2>Community Ownership</h2>
			<p><strong>We stand with</strong> workers against exploitative employers and businesses who profit off of climate destruction.</p>
			<p><strong>We fight for</strong> a world in which businesses are owned by the communities in which they operate.</p>

			<h2>Multigenerational Leadership</h2>
			<p><strong>We stand with</strong> the youth inheriting a world deeply damaged by climate destruction, and with older generations who face increased vulnerability from a collapsing climate.</p>
			<p><strong>We fight for</strong> a world where people can live with dignity for generations to come.</p>

			<h2>Animal Liberation</h2>
			<p><strong>We stand with</strong> non-human animals whose bodies are destroyed and exploited for profit and selfish purposes.</p>
			<p><strong>We fight for</strong> a world where all creatures can live in dignity and peace.</p>

			<h2>Climate Reparations</h2>
			<p><strong>We stand with and fight for</strong> all victims of the climate crisis, who must receive justice directly from the corporations and colonizers causing the crisis.</p>
