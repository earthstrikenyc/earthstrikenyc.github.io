			<h1>Our Principles</h1>
			<p>Earth Strike NYC is an autonomous member of the international Earth Strike collective. We believe:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Climate destruction is an injustice caused by colonialism and capitalism.</li>
				<li>It impacts different groups in different and intersecting ways.</li>
				<li>To confront the climate crisis, we must take direct action against colonialism and capitalism.</li>
				<li>This action must center the radical climate demands of the direct victims of these systems.</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>General organizing principles</h2>
			<p><i>Jemez principles. These were written by the Southwest Network for Environmental and Economic Justice, 1996.</i></p>

			<ol>
				<li>Be inclusive.</li>
				<li>Emphasis on bottom-up organizing</li>
				<li>Let people speak for themselves.</li>
				<li>Work together in solidarity and mutuality.</li>
				<li>Build just relationships among ourselves.</li>
				<li>Commitment to self-transformation</li>
			</ol>

			<p><i>ES-NYC specific principles:</i></p>

			<p>We oppose colonialism and capitalism full stop. We choose to focus our energies against those manifestations of capitalism which most directly relate to our demands.</p>

			<h2>Specific principles</h2>
			<p><i>St. Paul principles. These were written by various groups protesting the Republican National Convention, St. Paul, MN, 2008.</i></p>

			<ol>
				<li>Our solidarity will be based on respect for a diversity of tactics and the plans of other groups.</li>
				<li>The actions and tactics used will be organized to maintain a separation of time or space.</li>
				<li>Any debates or criticisms will stay internal to the movement, avoiding any public or media denunciations of fellow activists and events.</li>
				<li>We oppose any state repression of dissent, including surveillance, infiltration, disruption and violence. We agree not to assist law enforcement actions against activists and others.</li>
